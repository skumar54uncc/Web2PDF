## 📌 About the Project

The **Web2PDF Converter** is a full-stack Python web app that extracts links from:
- Raw text input
- PDF / DOCX uploads
- Public Google Docs

It renders each webpage using a headless browser, bypasses Cloudflare, auto-scrolls to load full content, removes popups, and **saves a clean PDF** for each link.

✨ Features:
- 🎯 Link extraction from diverse formats (Google Docs, DOCX, PDF)
- 🧠 Auto-expands long pages (scrolls, expands "read more")
- 🔐 Cloudflare detection bypass
- 📄 Auto-saves pages as numbered PDFs
- 📦 ZIP of all PDFs + CSV report
- ⚡ Confetti animation, live status updates, responsive design
- ☀️ Light/Dark mode, mobile-friendly, and cancel button for long jobs
